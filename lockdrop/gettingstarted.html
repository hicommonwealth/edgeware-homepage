      <h3>Creating an address</h3>
      <div class="wallet-explanation">
        To create an Edgeware mnemonic and keypair locally, follow the
        steps below.  If you would rather create a keypair online,
        visit the <a href="https://edgewa.re/keygen/index.html"
        target="_blank">key generator</a>.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Install rust and cargo <a href="https://rustup.rs/" target="_blank">here</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Execute the following script once cargo is installed
          <pre>cargo install --force --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate subkey</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Create an account by running the following command
          <pre>subkey generate</pre>
          Save the output somewhere safe, it contains your secret mnemonic
          to generate future keypairs.
          <br/>
          It should look like the following:
          <pre>Phrase `welcome draft actor now search injury enhance cigar misery move december essay` is account:
            Seed: 0xa2cc1ebe0a6cb0ae78311cd37156aac988e61c312d73cafe357cc2f1fd069e09
            Public key (hex): 0xb2d1bda2d363cf25a26a9fb34ea314dc8981e378ca4797c52117f65731602826
            Address (SS58): 5G7AgnBBNvdDYRVvcCYz95pMjGtS3ouWaq23Dcqe6rDjDuh7</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Copy the Public key (hex) for use on the Edgeware Lockdrop homepage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Note that if you intend to be a validator when the network
          launches, you will need to generate three public keys, two
          of which should be sr25519 keys as above:
          <pre>subkey generate</pre>
          One key should be an ed25519 key:
          <pre>subkey generate -e</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Unlocking</h3>
      <div class="wallet-explanation">
        To trigger unlocking of ETH stored in a user lockdrop
        contract, wait until the locktime has expired, and send any
        transaction to the user lockdrop contract's address.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          After sending a lock transaction, any ETH that was sent to
          the <strong>master lockdrop contract</strong> will be
          transferred into a <strong>user lockdrop contract</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can find the user lockdrop contract by going to your
          lock transaction on Etherscan, and looking for the contract
          created by that transaction:
          <a href="unlocktx.png">
            <img src="unlocktx.png" class="image"/>
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a transaction sending 0 ETH to that contract address,
          from any address. As long as the lock has expired, funds
          will be automatically released to the address that originally
          locked them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Testing on Ropsten</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The lockdrop contract deployed on Ropsten
          at <code>0x111ee804560787E0bFC1898ed79DAe24F2457a04</code>
          has shorter locktimes of 15min, 30min, and 60min, instead of
          3, 6, and 12 months respectively.
